# <!-- fit -->$q = \prod_{i = 1}^{k}q_i,p = \prod_{j = k+1}^{k+k'}q_j,Q=p*q$
###### $where \quad k=4 \quad k'=5$

# <!-- fit --> $A_j\equiv(\sum({A_i*\tilde{q_i}}mod q_{i})*q_i^*-V'*q)mod q_j$

######  $V'=\lfloor \sum(A_i*\tilde{q_i}modq_i^*)/q_i \rceil$

After complete the RNS basis extension, the ciphertext multiplication is performed in the RNS of R Q in parallel. Then,the extended tensored ciphertexts need to be scaled down

### Architecture
#### Overall Architecture
![bg right 100%](https://github.com/Muxucao0812/Paper-Management/blob/main/Pic/ReMCA_Pic/Architecture%20of%20ReMCA.png?raw=true)
Reconfigurable PE Array: perform NTT/INTT, the modular multplication
TF ROM Array: store the twiddle factor array
Data RAM Array: store the input polynomials, intermediate results and final results

---
One row or multiple rows of PE can be configured as a channel to perform the polynomial arithmetic operations on one RNS
base.
Total of 40 PEs, in which each row corresponds to one channel and each channel contains two slices and 8 PEs (4 for each slice). To maximize the parallelism of the processing path and match the number of extended RNS bases, set five channels in PE array.

### Architecture
#### Reconfigurable PE Unit
![bg right 100%](https://github.com/Muxucao0812/Paper-Management/blob/main/Pic/ReMCA_Pic/Architecture%20of%20reconfigurable%20PE.png?raw=true)

Reconfigurable PE: INTT,NTT,MULT
Barrett modular multiplier: modular multiplier, modular reduction


---
1.PE not only supports the functions with the variable modulus, but also supports the summation of modular multiplication
2.By merging the multiplicative factor 1/2 into the twiddle factors, the reconfigurable PE eliminates the multiplication of 1/2 in the subtraction path and improves the performance of PE unit.
$\frac{x}{2}= (2\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+1)\frac{q+1}{2}=\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor(q+1)+\frac{q+1}{2}=\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+\frac{q+1}{2}(modq)$?
3.The Barrett modular multiplier we presented employs a reconfigurable architecture and avoids the needs of other computing units for ReMCA.

Bank is dual-port pattern(could select the bank read port based on PEs)
For the bit-reversal operation, could change the address mapping pattern to avoid timing-consuming or memory-consuming.

- MEMA is used to store the inputs/outputs and intermediates results of almost all functional units in homomorphic evaluation of RNS-BFV except for the NTT and INTT. 
 
- MEMB is mainly used to store the inputs/outputs and intermediate results of NTT and INTT(MEMB is enough?4096*2?)
