### Preliminaries
#### The Textbook BFV Scheme
- BFV.KeyGen($\lambda,\omega$)
- BFV.Enc($m,pk$)
- BFV.Dec($ct,sk$)
- BFV.HomAdd($ct_0,ct_1$)
- BFV.HomMult($ct_0,ct_1,rlk$)

### Preliminaries
#### Parameter Setup
- polynomial degree: 4096
- the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution to Ïƒ: 3.19
- the size of modulus *q*: 128 bit(product of four 32 bit primes)?
- the size of the larger modulus Q to at least 288-bit(product of nine 32 bit primes)
- 32-bit primes to construct the RNS for our implementation

 It is a algorithm can control the butterfly unit to do NTT or INTT, decrease the complexity of memory access.

Chinese remainder theorem
# <!-- fit -->$q = \prod_{i = 1}^{k}q_i,p = \prod_{j = k+1}^{k+k'}q_j,Q=p*q$
###### $where \quad k=4 \quad k'=5$

# <!-- fit --> $A_j\equiv(\sum({A_i*\tilde{q_i}}mod q_{i})*q_i^*-V'*q)mod q_j$

######  $V'=\lfloor \sum(A_i*\tilde{q_i}modq_i^*)/q_i \rceil$

Reconfigurable PE Array: perform NTT/INTT, the modular multplication. One
row or multiple rows of PE can be configured as a channel to perform the polynomial arithmetic operations on one RNS
base.
TF ROM Array: store the twiddle factor array
Data RAM Array: store the input polynomials, intermediate results and final results
Total of 40 PEs, in which each row corresponds to one channel and each channel contains two slices and 8 PEs (4 for each slice). To maximize the parallelism of the processing path and match the number of extended RNS bases, set five channels in PE array.

Reconfigurable PE: INTT,NTT,MULT
Barrett modular multiplier: modular multiplier, modular reduction
1.PE not onlu supports the functions with the variable modulus, but also supports the summation of modular multiplication
2.By merging the multiplicative factor 1/2 into the twiddle factors, the reconfigurable PE eliminates the multiplication of 1/2 in the subtraction path and improves the performance of PE unit.
$\frac{x}{2}= (2\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+1)\frac{q+1}{2}=\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor(q+1)+\frac{q+1}{2}=\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+\frac{q+1}{2}(modq)$
3.The Barrett modular multiplier we presented employs a reconfigurable architecture and avoids the needs of other computing units for ReMCA.

Bank is dual-port pattern(could select the bank read port based on PEs)
For the bit-reversal operation, could change the address mapping pattern to avoid timing-consuming or memory-consuming.

MEM consists of four memory banks, where each memory bank further contains four 1024-depth and 32-bit-width dual-port RAMs. 
MEMA is used to store
the inputs/outputs and intermediates results of almost all functional units in homomorphic evaluation of RNS-BFV
except for the NTT and INTT.
MEMB is mainly used to store the inputs/outputs and intermediate results of NTT and INTT
