# Title: ReMCA: A Reconfigurable Multi-Core Architecture for Full RNS Variant of BFV Homomorphic Evaluation(TCAS I)

# <center>Preliminaries
## The Textbook BFV Scheme

## Parameter Setup
polynomial degree: 4096

the size of modulus *q*: 128 bit(product of four 32 bit primes)

the standard deviation of the Gaussian
distribution to Ïƒ: 3.19

the size of the larger modulus Q
to at least 288-bit

32-bit primes to construct the RNS for our implementation
# <center>Algorithm And Approach
## Unified Low-Complexity NTT/INTT

It is a algorithm can control the butterfly unit to do NTT or INTT
, decrease the complexity of memory access.

## Overall Architecture

Reconfigurable PE Array: perform NTT/INTT, the modular multplication. One
row or multiple rows of PE can be configured as a channel
to perform the polynomial arithmetic operations on one RNS
base.

TF ROM Array: store the twiddle factor array

Data RAM Array: store the input polynomials, intermediate results and final results

Total of 40 PEs, in which each row corresponds to one channel and each channel contains two slices and 8 PEs (4 for each slice). To maximize the parallelism of the processing path and match the number of extended RNS bases, set five channels in PE array.
## Reconfigurable PE Unit

Reconfigurable PE: INTT,NTT,MULT

Barrett modular multiplier: modular multiplier, modular reduction

1.PE not onlu supports the functions with the variable modulus, but also supports the summation of modular multiplication

2.By merging the multiplicative factor 1/2 into the twiddle
factors, the reconfigurable PE eliminates the multiplication of
1/2 in the subtraction path and improves the performance of
PE unit.

$\frac{x}{2}= (2\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+1)\frac{q+1}{2}=\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor(q+1)+\frac{q+1}{2}=\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+\frac{q+1}{2}(modq)$

3.The Barrett modular multiplier we presented employs a reconfigurable architecture and avoids the needs of other computing units for ReMCA.
## Confilct-Free Memory Access for NTT/INTT

Bank is dual-port pattern(could select the bank read port based on PEs)

For the bit-reversal operation, could change the address mapping pattern to avoid timing-consuming or memory-consuming.
