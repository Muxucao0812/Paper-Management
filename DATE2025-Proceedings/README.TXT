Section 1. Software Requirements
Adobe(R) Reader(R) 11.0
==========================================================

To browse the files on this disc, you will need to have 
Adobe(R) Reader(R) that is specific to your platform and 
OS installed. In order to take full advantage of the disc's 
capabilities, we recommend using Adobe(R) Reader(R) 11 or higher.
If there was room available on this disc, installs for Adobe(R) 
Reader(R) for Windows(R), Macintosh and Linux are located in 
a folder named INSTALLS in the root directory of this disc.

RECOMMENDATION TO USER
It is recommended that Adobe(R) Reader(R) Version 11 or higher be
used to navigate and view the disc contents. Adobe(R) Reader(R)11
installs are included on the disc for some operating systems.
Other versions are available at www.adobe.com

For Adobe(R) Reader(R)version 9 or higher, it is recommended that you
set your viewing preferences to not view in PDF/A mode. If
you view in this mode, the bookmarks in the manuscripts
will not function properly. The PDF/A mode is set in your
Adobe(R) Reader(R) Preferences under the Edit Menu.

==========================================================
Section 2. Using Features
==========================================================

We recommend reviewing the Adobe(R) Reader(R) built-in Help 
section to gain optimum use of the files on this disc.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Navigating
-----------------------------------------------------------

When viewing a paper, there are three methods of 
returning to the electronic guide.

* Use the first bookmark inserted into the paper to Return 
  to the Proceedings. This will take you to the previous page
  you were on.
  
* Use the second bookmark inserted into the paper to Return
  to Main Menu. This will take you back to the very beginning
  of the electronic guide.

* Use the functions of the Adobe(R) Reader(R) tool bar. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Searching
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are two recommendations for the Search function in 
Adobe(R) Reader(R) 11. From the Edit menu, select Preferences and 
then Search.

1. Check the "Always use advanced search" box. This gives you
more options when conducting searches

2. Change the "Maximum number of documents returned in 
Results" from 100 to 10000. This collection contains many
files and this will list more of them in the results 
from a search.

*For Mac users: To set the search function go to the 
the Adobe Reader menu at the top of the screen, choose 
Preferences, and then Search. Follow steps 1 and 2 above to
set the search function.

To learn about the full capabilities of this Search tool, 
please reference the Adobe(R) Reader(R) built-in help section. 
This can be accessed via Help/Reader Help.

Section 3. Troubleshooting
==========================================================

Q:  When I print a document, some of the text is cut off.

A:  Select Shrink oversized papers to paper size under 
File/Print. This will capture the entire image on to your 
print out. (For additional information, please see your 
printer documentation.)

Q:  When I closed the file I was viewing, the Guide file 
was also closed and I had to reopen it.

A:  Instead of closing the file, use Previous Views or the
bookmarks in the file to return to the electronic guide file. 
For additional information, refer to the Adobe(R) Reader(R)
Help.

Q:  Screen refresh and printing takes an extraordinarily 
long time on my system.

A:  Under Edit/Preferences/Display, turn off the options for 
Smooth Text & Smooth Images.

Q: (Macintosh users) The Adobe(R) Reader(R) Search feature is 
not functioning.

A: This issue can sometimes occur when using versions of 
Adobe(R) Reader(R) 9. Upgrading to the latest version will 
solve this problem. The latest version of Adobe(R) Reader(R)
is available in the INSTALLS folder located on this disc, or 
by visiting www.Adobe.com

Q: (Macintosh users) When I do a search, I get a message "An 
internal error has occurred. Can't retrieve the results. 
Sorry."

A: This is a known Adobe problem. It occurs when a search is 
conducted on a group of files in which the first 64 
characters of some titles are identical. Please see 
Help/Reader Help/Searching Catalog Indexes to narrow the 
search parameters and avoid this from happening.
